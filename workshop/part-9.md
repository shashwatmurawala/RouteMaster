# Part 9: Next Steps

## Congrats! ðŸŽ‰

You now have a working full-stack application that persists users to a database. Where you go from here is up to you. Here are some suggestions:

- Create more tables that relate to each other with [foreign keys](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/create-table.html#create-a-table-with-a-foreign-key-constraint).
- Use an ORM to like [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to manage andconnect to the database.
- Add more pages to the front end.

### A quick note about CORS

This Repl is configured to have FastAPI serve the built React Application files. You may choose to deploy the front-end and back-end code separately. For example, you could deploy the front end as a static site to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/with/react/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-react-with-vercel) and keep the back end on Replit or deploy to [Render](https://render.com/docs/web-services).
For this to work, we have to set up [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) support on the server. If you look at `fabric-stack-workshop/backend/backend/main.py` you notice a list of `origins`.

```python
origins = ["http://localhost:3000", "localhost:3000"]
```

Once you deploy your front end, you'll want to make sure to add the new origin to the list to prevent CORS errors from appearing in your browser's developer console.
