# Part 9: Next Steps

## Congrats! ðŸŽ‰

You now have a working full stack application that persists users to a database. Where you go from here is up to you. Here are some suggestions:

- Create more tables that relate to each other with [foriegn keys](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/create-table.html#create-a-table-with-a-foreign-key-constraint)
- Use an ORM to like [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to manage andconnect to the database.
- Add more pages to the frontend

### A quick note about CORS

This application works by having a frontend on one origin (localhost:3000) make requests to a server on another domain (localhost:8000). For this to work, we have to set up [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) support on the server. If you look at `fabric-stack-workshop/backend/backend/main.py` you notice a list of `origins`.

```python
origins = ["http://localhost:3000", "localhost:3000"]
```

Once you deploy your frontend, you'll want to make sure to add the new origin to the list to prevent CORS errors from appearing in your browser's developer console.
